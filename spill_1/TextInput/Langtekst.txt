Next month, a giant asteroid will hurtle towards our planet. On 29 April 2020, 
the space rock - described as "half the size of Everest" - will be visible from earth as it comes chillingly close to us.

Official name 1998 OR2, the asteroid is set to pass by earth just before 10am on 29 April, when will be 3.9 million miles from our planet. 
This may sound far away, but it is close enough to be considered a "near Earth object" (NEO) by NASA. The space agency considers anything passing within 120 million miles of Earth a NEO.
